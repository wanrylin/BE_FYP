Here are all necessary MATLAB codes for the project. <br>
**!!Attention!!**<br>
**you can not load the .csi file into workspace without installing PicoScenes MATLAB toolbox which you can find the instruction at
[PicoScenes homepage](https://ps.zpj.io/matlab.html) <br>
Meanwhile, the PicoScenes toolbox has updated for many versions which means the CSIdatapro function cannot read the .csi file correctly under current toolbox version. Therefore, please run the system with Test folder.** <br>
The main file is respiration_monitoring.m and vital_sign_monitoring.m. <br>
respiration_monitoring.m is used to estimate the breath rate which is programmed as README shows. vital_sign_monitoring.m contains both 
breath rate and heart rate estimation. But the breath rate estimation is not designed as README shows which performs weak.
